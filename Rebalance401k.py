# 1. Input: total of all $$ in all retirement accounts
# 2. Input: current $$ totals in each 401k account
# 3. Add totals together, and calculate proportion of each to sum total
# 4. Find % of sum total to retirement total
# 5. Compare sum total % to goal proportion total % (for 401k categories)
# 6. Adjust goal proportion to match actual proportion ideal
# 7. Use actual proportion ideal to calculate ideal $$ totals for each (use for later comparison)
# 8. Find absolute % for each category / account
# i.e. acct allocation % * cat allocation % = absolute %
# or acct allocation / all acct allocations (100% - non-participating accts) * cat allocation = absolute %
# 9. Output: relative % for each category / account
# i.e. absolute cat/acct % / absolute acct total % = relative %
# Use this to update existing percentages in accts, but for future stick to ideal in spreadsheet
